Contributing to Hyperledger Explorer
====================================

We welcome contributions to the Hyperledger Explorer Project in many forms like bug reports, feature requests,  documentation updates, code.

Getting a Linux Foundation account
----------------------------------

In order to participate in the development of the Hyperledger Explorer
project, you will need a :doc:`Linux Foundation
account <Gerrit/lf-account>`. You will need to use your LF ID to
access to all the Hyperledger community tools, including
`Gerrit <https://gerrit.hyperledger.org>`__,
`Jira <https://jira.hyperledger.org>`__,
`RocketChat <https://chat.hyperledger.org>`__.


Bug Reports and Feature Requests
--------------------------------

We track all bugs and feature requests on `Hyperledger Explorer Jira <https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/BE/issues>`__.
Please send a detailed bug report with relevant logs and steps to reproduce the issue when you encounter an issue.
We always appreciate such bug reports as it reduces our effort and will help us fix the bug easily.
Please use the search functionality to ensure that the bug/feature request you are trying to file does not exist already.
If it exists, you can always add additional information to the JIRA issue in the comments sections and start watching for updates.
All the issue here will be added to our backlog and prioritized in the upcoming sprints.
You can contact the developers for any general problems or questions on `Hyperledger Explorer Chat <https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/hyperledger-explorer>`__.


Communications
--------------

We use `RocketChat <https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/hyperledger-explorer>`__ for communication
and Zoom meetingâ„¢ for screen sharing between developers. Our
development planning and prioritization is done in
`JIRA <https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=155&view=planning>`__, and we take longer running
discussions/decisions to the `mailing
list <https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/explorer>`__.

Contribution guide
------------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following are the software dependencies required to install and run Hyperledger Explorer:

- Nodejs 8.11.x (Note that v9.x is not yet supported)
- PostgreSQL 9.5 or greater
- `jq (command-line JSON processor) <https://stedolan.github.io/jq>`__
- Linux-based operating system, such as Ubuntu
- MacOS

Verified Docker versions supported:

- `Docker CE 18.09.2 or later <https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community&operating_system=linux>`__
- `Docker Compose 1.14.0 <https://docs.docker.com/compose>`__




Submitting your fix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you just submitted a JIRA for a bug you've discovered, and would like to
provide a fix, we would welcome that gladly! Please assign the JIRA issue to
yourself, then you can submit a change request (CR).

.. note:: If you need help with submitting your first CR, we have created a brief :doc:`CR <submit_cr>`.


Working on fixing issues and working stories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Review the `issues
list <https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=155&view=planning.nodetail>`__ and find
something that interests you.
Start with something relatively straight forward and
achievable, and that no one is already assigned. If no one is assigned,
then assign the issue to yourself. Please be considerate and rescind the
assignment if you cannot finish in a reasonable time, or add a comment
saying that you are still actively working the issue if you need a
little more time.


Setting up development environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, try :doc:`building the project <dev-setup/build>` in your local
development environment to ensure that everything is set up correctly.

Submitting your change request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Changes should be small, and should cover one jira.

-  Add a link to the JIRA story when submitting the change.

-  Create unit and integration tests (or update to existing tests)
   with every change.

-  Any new or updated unit tests should have NO external dependencies.
   Unit tests can be run from the project root ``blockchain-explorer`` with ``./main.sh install && ./main.sh test`` .

-  Write a short and meaningful commit message, no more than 55 (or less)
   character title, followed by a blank line.
   Each commit MUST include the JIRA corresponding to the change (e.g. [BE-55]).

.. note:: Gerrit automatically creates a hyperlink to the JIRA item.
          e.g.

          ::

              [BE-55] Handle 500 error

              Fix [BE-55] handling 500 error when server fails to return a request.
