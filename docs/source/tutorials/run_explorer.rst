								Hyperledger Explorer project team did not test, or setup to run explorer in kubernetes, but someone did a tremendous job in setting it,
								and added an explanation on how to set it up.
								If you're interested to experiment, and willing to give a try you're more than welcomed.
								Please let us know if you succeeded in `running explorer in kubernetes <https://github.com/feitnomore/hyperledger-fabric-kubernetes>`__.
