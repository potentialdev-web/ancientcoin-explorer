Getting Started with Hyperledger Explorer
=========================================

TODO

.. add an introduction on how to start using HLExplorer, short description with using images, and explanation what are the futures with notes on images
.. located in blockchain-explorer/docs/source/images

Hyperledger Explorer can run locally in your local environment or using docker. Minimum configuration allows you to get it setup up, and running
in short time.
There are well defined steps and `instructions <https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer/blob/master/README.md>`__ how to get you setup and
run HL Explorer successfully. Along with the instructions you may find useful
`troubleshooting notes <https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOT.md>`__, that were collected, and or submitted
by community through the `mail listings <https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/explorer/topics>`__  or
`Rocket Chat <https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/hyperledger-explorer>`__ hyperledger-explorer channel.

								Hyperledger Explorer project team did not test, or setup to run explorer in kubernetes, but someone did a tremendous job in setting it,
								and added an explanation on how to set it up.
								If you're interested to experiment, and willing to give a try you're more than welcomed.
								Please let us know if you succeeded in `running explorer in kubernetes <https://github.com/feitnomore/hyperledger-fabric-kubernetes>`__.
